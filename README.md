# Food Image Classification

This project involves developing an image classification model to recognize different types of food items from images. The project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify food images into various categories.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and fine-tune a CNN model to classify images of different food items. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection

- Collect a dataset of food images categorized into various classes.
- The dataset should be organized into folders where each folder represents a class of food.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Resize Images:** Resize images to a consistent size to match the input dimensions of the model.
- **Normalize Pixel Values:** Scale pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 for better training performance.
- **Split Data:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 3. Model Architecture

- Choose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture suitable for image classification. Common choices include:
  - **VGG:** A deep CNN architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness.
  - **ResNet:** A CNN architecture that uses residual blocks to enable training of very deep networks.
  - **MobileNet:** A lightweight CNN architecture designed for mobile and edge devices.

### 4. Transfer Learning

- Use a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG, ResNet, MobileNet) and fine-tune it for the specific task of food classification.
- Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models on large datasets and adapts them to the specific classification problem.

### 5. Model Training

- Train the model on the preprocessed dataset using the chosen architecture.
- Monitor training and validation performance to ensure the model is learning effectively.

### 6. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the model's accuracy and other relevant metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) on the test dataset.
- Use confusion matrices and classification reports to assess performance.

### 7. Visualization

- Visualize model predictions on sample images.
- Explore misclassified images to understand and improve model performance.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** Programming language used for developing the model.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** Libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the model.
- **Image Processing Libraries:** Libraries like OpenCV or PIL for image manipulation and preprocessing.
